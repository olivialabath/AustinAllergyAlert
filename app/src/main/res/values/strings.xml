    <string name="about_text">Austin Allergy Alert was created to let people in Austin, TX view daily allergy counts and record the severity of their allergy symptoms.
            \n\nAllergen counts are found at twitter.com/ATXPollen, and are only reported on weekdays.
            \n\nAllergens are divided into 4 groups: mold, grass, weed, and tree. Pet dander is not reported.
